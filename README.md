# ATON 2.0 framework (alpha)

The ATON 2.0 framework - developed by B. Fanini (CNR ISPC, ex ITABC) - allows to create scalable and *cross-device* Web-Apps (mobile, desktop and immersive VR) exploiting modern web standards, without any installation required for the final user. ATON offers:
* responsive, adaptive and scalable presentation of interactive 3D content
* paged multi-resolution
* event-driven API
* multi-temporal (4D) visualization
* immersive VR (WebVR/XR) and (multi)-touch devices presentation
* complex scene-graph manipulation (hierarchies, instancing, node transformations, etc.)
* 3D annotations, semantic 3D descriptors and advanced modules for 4D inspection
* advanced multi-texturing, PBR features and shader customization
* camera/POV transitions, custom POV handling and navigation constraints
* customizable dynamic recommendation systems
* Spherical panoramas and IBL

The framework also provides *built-in* services based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for deployment on servers, infrastructures or single-board computers; real-time collaborative features through the *VRoadcast* component and remote/immersive visual analytics.

## Getting started
First install/update ATON services:
```
cd services/
npm update
```
